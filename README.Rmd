# dhtk

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview
The goal of dhtk is to provide a collection of functions meant to ease general DH work. It is meant to be used along side various other text mining/ corpus linguistics tools, and to make using these other tools easier and more expedient. The packages it is intended to work along side at the moment include: 

  * [tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/vignettes/tm.pdf)
  * [topicmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf)
  * [LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)

## Installation

You can install dhtk from [Github](https://github.com) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Jpowell94/dhtk")
```

## Usage

dhtk allows you to work _smarter_. Make use of already existing tools in your DH projects with ease and by writing fewer lines of code to get your results.

```{r example}
library(dhtk)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
